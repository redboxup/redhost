  <h1>cout<<"Hello World!\n";</h1>
 <p>Hello World!</br></br>
When I first started learning C++ I had not realised the significance of 
"Hello World". It is one of the oldest traditions in programming and even today everytime
someone starts learing a new language the first thing they do is to get the computer to say
the magical words.</p>
<p>There is something fascinating about programing that has never ceased to amaze me.A set of 
rules and algorithm crafted properly can make anything possible in the digital realm. All that is 
needed is infalliable logic and reason.</p>
<p>This marriage of mechanical automaton and creative mind is the greatest gift to the mankind.
To be able to perform any task billions of times over in mere seconds without compromising
precision or accuracy is impossible to recreate by any human. No person in history
could even begin to imagine that such feat is even possible. And yet we are living in a time
when each and everyone of us has access to such powerful devices at our fingertips.
<p>When I think about all of this I can't stop feeling that childish excitement in me. With each 
day the world is only getting better and I don't want to be left behind on that so I have always
been in a race to catch up with. The only reason I have been able to come this far is because of
access to countless resources that have been made freely available by great people from all 
world over through internet.</p>
<p>This blog is just a very small effort to give back to the internet and such amazing people 
by sharing what all I have accumulated and learnt over the years. Though its not much but I am
sure that even if it helps a couple of people find answers to the questions they have been looking
for and make them more enthusiastic about learning then my effort would be worthwhile
<p>And with that I bid farewell (just for today) and I wish you best of wishes</p>
