    <p>A big part of programing is spent inside an editor fiddling with the code debugging and trying to make it work like you want it too. It is never like in the movies where the protagonist has his fingers fluttering over the keyboard with internal monologues about how fun it is "owning" a system *cough* Mr Robot *cough*. Most of the time is spent on trying to understand why in the gods name the error is showing up and what does it even mean.</p>
    <p>The first programing language I ever learnt was C++ in my school. Before that I had no idea what programing even was and yet I had gotten so used to itthat when we had to use ubuntu-linux in college for some c++ programming,I still used turboc++ for a while due to equal parts naivety and equal parts I didn't want to use something I had never used before</p>
    <p>And probably there are certain instant even you can recount where we refuse try something new because of its unfamiliarity, even though we might know it is better for us. Even though from an evolution standpoint it makes sense, in the 21st century it will only hinder us from making the right choice.</p>
    <p>So why am I all of a sudden sharing all this information, well its because I have finally, after procrastinating for too long, decided to get started with the emacs editor. And I would highly encourage even you to get started.If you don't know about emacs, its fine! Even I didn't know it existed a couple of months ago. I was happy and complacent using geditor, nano and cat. But they are very basic and are outrageously insufficient when we need to write very long programs. Emacs is a really good editor that can not only perform all the tasks an editor,but is also highly customizable and its functionality could be extended to various requirements. Hell! you can even read YOUR EMAIL on Emacs! Now how cool is that></p>
    <p>Now, I am no way in any position to explain it even better, so why don't you look into it yourself.It is multi-dimensional and it is something you wont regret learning.</p>
    With that I am signing off for today!
