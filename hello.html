  <h1>Hello World</h1>
 <p>Hello friend</br>
When I first started learning C++ in 11th class I had not realised the significance of </br>
"Hello World". It is one of the oldest traditions in programming and even today everytime </br>
someone starts learing a new language the first thing they do is to get the computer to say</br>
the magical words.</p>
<p>There is something fascinating about programing that has never ceased to amaze me.A set of </br>
rules and algorithm crafted properly can make anything possible in the digital realm. All that is </br>
needed is infalliable logic and reason.</p>
<p>This marriage of mechanical automaton and creative mind is the greatest gift to the mankind.</br>
To be able to perform any task billions of times over in mere seconds without compromising </br>
precision or accuracy is impossible to recreate by any human. No person in history</br>
could even begin to imagine that such feat is even possible. And yet we are living in a time </br>
when each and everyone of us has access to such powerful devices at our fingertips.</p>
<p>When I think about all of this I can't stop feeling that childish excitement in me. With each</br> 
day the world is only getting better and I don't want to be left behind on that so I have always</br>
been in a race to catch up with. The only reason I have been able to come this far is because of</br>
access to countless resources that have been made freely available by great people from all </br>
world over through internet.</p>
<p>This blog is just a very small effort to give back to the internet and such amazing people </br> 
by sharing what all I have accumulated and learnt over the years. Though its not much but I am </br>
sure that even if it helps a couple of people find answers to the questions they have been looking</br>
for and make them more enthusiastic about learning then my effort would be worthwhile</p>
<p>And with that I bid farewell (just for today) and I wish you best of wishes</p>
