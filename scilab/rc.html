<h3> Series RC - Circuit</h3>
<p>Series RC circuit has varying current under a DC source. A capacitor ideally gets charged and discharged in 0 seconds. But when it is used in series with a resistor it takes some time to charge or discharge. We can express current in the circuit using a differential equation.</p>

<p>Using KVL in the circuit
$$ V_{DC} = iR + \frac{Q}{C}$$
$$Replacing: Q = \int idt$$
$$ V_{DC} = iR + \frac{1}{C} \int idt $$
Differentiating on both sides
$$ 0 = R\frac{di}{dt} + \frac{1}{C} idt $$
$$ \frac{di}{dt} = -\frac{i}{RC}$$
Thus we have obtained the Differential equation that describes the current in the circuit. We can solve this differential equation to find the value of 'i' at any moment 't'.</p>
The analytic solution of the given differential equation is covered in the next part:
<br><h3>Analytic Solution</h3>
<p>Integrating on both sides
$$ \int_{i_0}^{i}\frac{di}{dt}= -\int_{0}^{t} \frac{i}{RC}  $$
$$ \log_{e}(\frac{i}{i0}) +\frac{T}{RC} = 0$$
Taking natural logarithm on both sides
$$ i = i_0e^{-\frac{1}{RC}T}$$
<p>Thus we  can see that solution of the differential equation is also an exponential function which is raised to the power of -T/RC. Thus the nature of the solution will be similar to the previous program </p>
<h3>Scilab Program</h3>
<p>Now, we'll use scilab to solve odinary differential equations.We will use the inbuilt ode() function which solves explicit odinary differential equations, defined by 
$$ \frac{dy}{dt} = f(y,t)$$
such that 
$$y(t_0) = y_0$$
Though the knowledge of the numerical methods being used is not required for further information you can always do further reading from scilab's official
<a href="https://help.scilab.org/docs/6.0.0/en_US/ode.html">website</a>.</p>
<p>The following is the program for calculating the variation of current in the series RC-circuit</p>
<pre>
<span class="inner-pre" style="font-size: 15px">
			i0=20
			R = 5
			T0 = 0
			C = 0.02
			T = linspace(0,1,100);
			function di = f(T,i)
			    di = -1/(R*C)*i
			endfunction
			n = ode(i0,T0,T,f); 
			plot(T,n)
			xlabel("time(sec)")
			ylabel("Current(mA)")
			title("Solution of Series RC circuit")
				
</span>
</pre>
Similar to the previous program I'll be segmenting the program and explaining each segments function in brief.
</br>
<p>The first step is initialising variables. These variables are used to represent the various element of the ode.<br>
R is the Resistance in ohms</br>
T0 is the instantaneos second from which time is noted</br>
C is the Capacitence of the circuit </br>
and T is the array of elements of time at each moment</br>
<pre>
<span class="inner-pre" style="font-size: 15px">
i0=20
			R = 5
			T0 = 0
			C = 0.02
			T = linspace(0,1,100);

</span>
</pre>
</br>
<p>The function of the program is the function which is equal to di\dt:</p>
<pre>
<span class="inner-pre" style="font-size: 15px">
			function di = f(T,i)
			    di = -1/(R*C)*i
			endfunction
							
</span>
</pre>
</br>
<p> The inbuilt ode function performs the numerical analysis and stores the result of current at each moment in 'n'.Thus, n is also an array whose size is equal to the size of T.
