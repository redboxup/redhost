<h1>Other differential equations</h1> 


We have examined the behaviour of two simple differential equations 
so far, one for population growth, and one for the radioactive decay 
of a substance. The methods we have developed are actually useful for many 
other interesting problems, and can help us to make predictions about 
other systems that, at first sight, do not seem at all related. We will find 
that the common thread in all these systems is the simple differential 
equation of the form 
<p> 
<center> 
 

</center> 
<p> 
This equation is of interest 
 for either positive or negative values of the constant 
 
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_2.gif" alt="$ r $ ">
. In fact, in the examples studied so far, we looked 
at one case in which  
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_3.gif" alt="$ r=k $ ">
, and another case in which 
 
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_4.gif" alt="$ r=-k $ ">
 . 
<p> 
Before continuing, let us recall that the behaviour of the solution(s) 
to this equation depend on whether the constant  

is positive or negative: 
<p> 
<center> 

</center> 
<br><br><p> 
With this in mind, let us examine another realization of a differential 
equation, this time connected with the property of cooling (or loss of heat) 
of a warm object in a colder environment. The following "Law" is an 
approximate description of experimentally observed behaviour. 

<h2>Newton's Law of Cooling</h2> 

<table cellpadding = 10> 
<td> Newton's Law of Cooling states that 
the rate of change of the temperature of 
an object is proportional to the difference between its own temperature 
and the ambient temperature (i.e. the temperature of its surroundings). 
</td> 
</table> 
<p> 

Newton's Law makes a statement about an <strong>instantaneous</strong> 
rate of change of the temperature. We will see that when we translate this 
verbal statement into a differential equation, we arrive at a 
differential equation. The <strong>solution</strong> to this equation 
will then be a function that tracks the complete record of the temperature 
over time. Newton's Law would enable us to solve the following problem.

Example 1: The Big Pot of Soup 
</b> </font> 
As part of his summer job at a resturant, Jim learned to cook up a big 
pot of soup late at night, just before closing time, 
so that there would be plenty of soup to feed 
customers the next day. He also found out that, while refrigeration 
was essential to preserve the soup overnight, the soup was too hot 
to be put directly into the fridge when it was ready. 
(The soup had just boiled at 100 degrees C, and the fridge was 
not powerful enough to accomodate a big pot of soup if it 
was any warmer than 20 degrees C). 
Jim discovered that 
by cooling the pot in a sink full of cold water, 
(kept running, so that its temperature was roughly constant 
at 5 degrees C) and stirring occasionally, 
he could bring tht temperature of the soup 
to 60 degrees C in ten minutes. How long before 
closing time should the soup be ready so that Jim could put it in the fridge 
and leave on time ? 
<br><br><br> 


<p> 
<strong> Solution:</strong> Let us summarize the information 
briefly and define notation for this problem. 
<br> Let 
<table cellpadding=10> 
<tr> 
<td> 
 
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_8.gif" alt="$ T(t) $ ">
 = Temperature of the soup at time t (in min).</td></tr> 
<tr> 
<td> 
 
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_9.gif" alt="$ T(0)=T_o $ ">
 = Initial Temperature of the soup =100 deg.</td></tr> 
<tr> 
<td> 
 
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_10.gif" alt="$ T_a $ ">
 = Ambient temperature (temp of water in sink) = 5 deg .</td> 
</tr> 
</table> 
<br> 
<br><strong>Given:</strong> 
The rate of change of the temperature 
 
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_11.gif" alt="$ dT/dt $ ">
, is (by Newton's Law of Cooling) proportional to the 
difference between the temperature of the soup  
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_12.gif" alt="$ T(t) $ ">
 and the 
ambient temperature  
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_13.gif" alt="$ T_a $ ">

This means that: 
<p> 
<center> 
 
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_14.gif" alt="
\[ 
\frac{dT}{dt} {\rm~ is~ proportional~ to~} (T - T_a). 
\] 
 ">

</center> 
<p> 
Here a bit of care is needed:  Clearly if the soup is hotter than the 
water in the sink  
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_15.gif" alt="$ T(t)-T_a > 0  $ ">
, then the soup is <strong>cooling 
down</strong> which means that the derivative  
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_16.gif" alt="$ dT/dt $ ">
 should be 
<strong>negative</strong>. (Remember the connection between a decreasing 
function and the sign of the derivative ?). This means that the 
equation we need has to have the following sign pattern: 
<p> 
<center> 
 
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_17.gif" alt="
\[ 
\frac{dT}{dt} = -k (T - T_a). 
\] 
 ">

</center> 
<p> 
where  
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_18.gif" alt="$ k $ ">
 is a positive constant. 
<br> 
This equation is another example of a <strong>differential equation</strong>. 
The independent variable is   
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_19.gif" alt="$ t $ ">
 for time, the function we want to 
find 
is   
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_20.gif" alt="$ T(t) $ ">
, and the quantities   
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_21.gif" alt="$ T_a, k $ ">
 
are constants. 
In fact, from Jim's measurements, we know that   
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_22.gif" alt="$ T_a=5 $ ">
, but we 
still don't know what value to put in for the constant   
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_23.gif" alt="$ k $ ">
. We will 
discuss this further below. 



<p> 
<h3> <img src="../../images/qbutton.gif"> 
For your consideration: </h3> 
<p> 
<ul> 
<li>(1) Check that the differential equation above makes sense. Can it also 
describe the case of a cold object heating up in a warmer environment? 
<P> 
<li>(2) What do you think the constant   
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_24.gif" alt="$ k $ ">
 represents ? 
<p> 
<li>(3) What units would this constant have ? 
<p> 
<li>(4) If you were to compare the rate of cooling of the soup inside 
a sealed styrofoam container, and inside a metal pot, which one might 
correspond to a larger value of k?

Back to the same old equation 
</b> </font> 
<br><br> 
The equation we arrived at above looks different from the ones we have 
just investigated, but as we shall soon see, the difference is rather 
superficial. Indeed, by defining a new variable, we will show that the 
equation is really completely related to the exponential decay seen 
previously. To see this, define

<p> 
(We have used the fact that   
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_29.gif" alt="$ T_a  $ ">
 is constant to eliminate its derivative, and we plugged 
in   
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_30.gif" alt="$ y $ ">
 for   
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_31.gif" alt="$ (T-T_a) $ ">
 in the last step.) What a 
nice surprize !   By defining this new variable, we have arrived once more 
at the familiar equation 
<p> 
<center> 
 

</center> 
<p> 
whose solution is well known to us, namely: 
<p> 
<center> 
 
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_33.gif" alt="
\[ 
y(t) = y_o e^{-kt} 
\] 
 ">

</center> 
<p> 
We can use this result to conclude (by plugging in  
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_34.gif" alt="$ y=(T-T_a) $ ">

and  
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_35.gif" alt="$ (T_o-T_a) $ ">
) that 
<p> 
<center> 
 
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_36.gif" alt="
\[ 
T(t)- T_a = (T_o-T_a) e^{-kt} 
\] 
 ">

</center> 
<p> 
It follows that 
<p> 
<center> 
 
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_37.gif" alt="
\[ 
T(t)= T_a + (T_o-T_a) e^{-kt} 
\] 
 ">

</center> 
<p> 
We found the solution in general form, but it looks quite complicated. 
Let's try to understand this expression and its predictions in the 
case of the problem described above. 
<p><br> 
<br> 
<font color = "#008800"> <b> 
How the soup will cool 
</b> </font> 
<br><br> 
From the information in the problem, we know that 
<p> 
<center> 
 
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_38.gif" alt="$ T(0)=T_o = 100, T_a = 5, T_o-T_a = 95  $ ">
 
</center> 
<p> 
so that, 
<p> 
<center> 
 
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_39.gif" alt="
\[ 
T(t)= 5 + 95 e^{-kt} 
\] 
 ">

</center> 
<p> 
We also know that after 10 minutes, the soup cools to 60 degrees, so that 
 
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_40.gif" alt="$ t=10, T(10)= 60  $ ">
. Plugging into the last equation, we find that 
<p> 
<center> 
 
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_41.gif" alt="
\[ 
60= T(10)= 5 + 95 e^{-10 k } 
\] 
 ">

</center> 
<p> 
Rearranging, 
<p> 
<center> 
 
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_42.gif" alt="
\[ 
60= 5 + 95 e^{-10 k }, ~~~~~~~~55=95 e^{-10 k },~~~~~~~~\frac{55}{95} = e^{-10 k }, 
~~~~~~~~~\frac{95}{55}= e^{10 k } 
\] 
 ">

</center> 
<p> 
(The steps are much the same as in our previous work in the example on 
radioactive decay. In the last step we took a reciprocal of both sides of the equation. This just makes all the quantities come out to be positive in the next 
step, so it is done for convenience, though it is not an essential step). We have found that 
<p> 
<center> 
 
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_43.gif" alt="
\[ 
e^{10 k }= 1.73 
\] 
 ">

</center> 
<p> 


Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, and 
solving for  
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_44.gif" alt="$ k $ ">
, we find that 
<p> 
<center> 
 
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_45.gif" alt="
\[ 
\ln(1.73)= \ln(e^{10 k }),~~~~~~~~~~ \ln(1.73)= 10 k 
\] 
 ">

</center> 
<p> 
Thus, 
<p> 
<center> 
 


</center> 
<p> 
So we see that the constant which governs the rate of cooling is 
  
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_47.gif" alt="$ k=0.054 $ ">
 per minute.  Now we can specify the solution fully, 
 since all constants have been determined from the information in the 
 problem. The prediction is that the temperature of the pot of soup at time 
 t will be 

The behaviour of this solution is shown in the diagram.

For your consideration: </h3> 
<p> 
<ul> 
<li> (1) Look at the behaviour of the solution corresponding to 
the function

. What will happen after a very long time? 
What will the eventual temperature of the soup be? 
<p> 
<li> (2) How can this be understood from the expression for

 ? Will this term be increasing or decreasing 
 with time?

<li> (3) What will the temperature of the soup be after 1 hour ? 
<p> 
<li> (4) Is there something analogous to a half life in this problem? 
<p> 
<li> (5) What would happen if Jim did not stirr the soup occasionally? 
Would it still cool the same way ? Would Newton's Law of Cooling apply just 
as before? Why are we assuming that the pot is well-stirred? 
<p> 
<li> (6) What would happen if the water in the sink was not running ? 
How would this change our assumption that the ambient temperature was 
a constant ?

Solving Jim's Soup problem 
</b> </font> 
<br><br> 
To finish our work, let us determine how long it takes for the 
soup to be cool enough to put into the refrigerator. We need to wait 
until  
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_52.gif" alt="$ T(t)=20 $ ">
, so at that time: 
<p> 
<center> 
 
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_53.gif" alt="
\[ 
20= 5 + 95 e^{-0.054t} 
\] 
 ">

</center> 
<p> 
This equation can be solved for  
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_54.gif" alt="$ t $ ">
 in much the same way as 
before. Subtracting 5 from both sides and dividing by 95 we get: 
<p> 
<center> 
 
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_55.gif" alt="
\[ 
\frac{15}{95} = e^{-0.054t}~~~~~\frac{95}{15}= 6.333 = e^{0.054 t} 
\] 
 ">

</center> 
<p> 
Taking logarithms of both sides, we find that 
<p> 
<center> 
 

</center> 
<p> 
Thus, using the fact that  
<img align=absmiddle src="mathgifs/cool_57.gif" alt="$  \ln(6.33)= 1.84 $ ">
 we have 
<p> 
<center> 
 

</center> 
<p> 
Thus, it will take a little over half an hour for Jim's soup to cool 
off enough to be put into the refrigerator.

<strong>Summary:</strong> 
<br><br> 
We have just seen yet another example of a simple differential equation and how 
it can be used to make predictions. To summarize what we found, here is the connection 
between the differential equation of Newton's Law of Cooling and its solution:
